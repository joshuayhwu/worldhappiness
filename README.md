In Economics, there is a theory called “Easterlin Paradox”. Where the country’s GDP growth doesn’t improve happiness in the long-run.

To test this theory, my goal was to use the same data the World Happiness Report uses from 2015 - 2019, originated from GallUp Polls, to generate a model to find significant factors contributing to a country’s happiness index.
